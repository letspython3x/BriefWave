## Scheduling

### Windows Task Scheduler

To schedule this script to run automatically on Windows:

1. Open Task Scheduler (search for it in the Start menu)
2. Click "Create Basic Task"
3. Enter a name and description for the task
4. Select the trigger (Daily, Weekly, etc.)
5. Select "Start a program" as the action
6. Browse to your Python executable (e.g., `C:\Python39\python.exe`)
7. Add the full path to your script in the "Add arguments" field (e.g., `C:\path\to\it-circulars-automation\main.py`)
8. Set the "Start in" field to your script's directory (e.g., `C:\path\to\it-circulars-automation`)
9. Complete the wizard and check "Open the Properties dialog" before finishing
10. In the Properties dialog, you can set additional options like running whether the user is logged in or not

### Linux/macOS Cron Job

To schedule this script on Linux or macOS:

1. Open your crontab file:
   ```
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a line to run the script at your desired schedule:
   ```
   # Run daily at 8 AM
   0 8 * * * cd /path/to/it-circulars-automation && /usr/bin/python3 main.py >> /path/to/it-circulars-automation/cron.log 2>&1
   ```

## OpenAI API Prerequisites

### Free Account Limitations
- Free tier accounts receive a limited amount of API credits (typically $5 worth)
- Credits expire after 3 months from account creation
- Rate limits apply to API requests
- Access to older models only, not necessarily the latest ones
- You may encounter "insufficient_quota" errors when credits are depleted

### Paid Account Requirements
- For reliable production use, a paid OpenAI account is recommended
- Paid accounts operate on a pay-as-you-go model with no credit expiration
- Higher rate limits and priority access during high traffic periods
- Access to the latest models and features
- Ability to set monthly spending limits to control costs

## Gmail SMTP & App Passwords

If you are using a Gmail account to send emails and have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, you must use an **App Password** instead of your regular account password for SMTP authentication.

**How to generate and use a Gmail App Password:**

1. Go to your [Google Account Security page](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Under "Signing in to Google", find **App passwords**. (You may need to sign in again.) [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
3. Generate a new app password for "Mail" and your device/app.
4. Use this generated password as your `SENDER_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file or environment variables.
5. Ensure your `SENDER_EMAIL` is your full Gmail address and SMTP settings are:
   - SMTP server: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - Port: `465` (SSL) or `587` (TLS)
   - Use SSL/TLS as appropriate

For more details, see the [Gmail support page](https://support.google.com/mail/?p=InvalidSecondFactor).

## Security Notes

- For Gmail, you need to use an App Password if you have 2-factor authentication enabled
- Store your OpenAI API key securely and never commit it to version control
- Consider using environment variables instead of a .env file in production environments
